## Gestures

A range of gestures can be defined to interact with the machine.
All of them are based on head movements because: 
1. Head is easier to move intentionally compared to the eye.
2. Very minute and quick head movements can be detected.

List of gestures:
1. Subtle vertical nod
    1. Easiest and the Quickest.
    2. Should be used for most common actions. (Something similar to a click on the mouse or tap on the phone.)
2. Subtle horizontal nod on towards left or right which can be used for next or previous / left or right swipe or arrow keys.
2. Turn the head on to a side and look towards to corner of the screen on the same side. (can be used for scrolling like actions)
